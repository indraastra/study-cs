* Availability =      MTBF (mean time between failures)
                  -------------
                   MTBF + MTTR (mean time to repair)

  eg. MTBF = 10,000 hrs
      MTTR = 20 hrs
   => Availability = 99.8%

  eg. MTBF = 30 days
      Maintainability = 25% repair chance/day
   => Availability = 88%
